# Animated-Image-Gallery
A performant image gallery site that can handle hundreds of large images and deliver a great user experience.
- I'll use the pexels Api and chakra-UI component library. I'll also use next.js component to optimize the images fetched from the pexels API
Run - (npx create-next-app image-gallery)
